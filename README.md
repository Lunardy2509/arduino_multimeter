This is a project called "PKM MAN IC", which stands for Program Kreativitas Mahasiswa for a school named Madrasah Aliyah Negeri Insan Cendekia located in Serpong, Tangerang Selatan, Indonesia. The main objective is to measure a solar panel system including solar PV, battery 12V 3A, and the inverter using an Arduino-based multimeter. This multimeter is purely for educational purposes and is used to measure the input and output power (watts) from solar PV to a certain electronic device i.e. electric fan. Moreover, this multimeter has a hold button to it then the user can freeze the values that have been checked, and unattached the values remain the same until the user unholds the button.
